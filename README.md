# my_sokoban
For this project we had to recreate the Sokoban game in C with the ncurses library. The goal of the game is to push all of the boxes on their emplacements, once this is done you win the game but if you get all of the boxes stuck you lose. 
To launch the game, you must clone the repository, execute the "make" command in a terminal at the root of the project and then you can launch the game by typing "./my_sokoban map.txt" with map being the chosen map (there is already one in the repository but you can make your own maps if you want)
Final grade: 88,9%
